IN THIS PROJECT MACHINE LEARINING FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN USED TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARINING ALGORITHMS 
AND DIFFERENT DATA SETS. SCIKIT-LEARN WHICH IS AN OPEN-SOURCE LIBRARY FOR PYTHON IS USED TO WORK WITH THEIR DIFFERENT 
BUILT IN ALGORITHEM.
THIS PROJECT PREDICT THE CHARACHTER OR DIGIT OF AN IMAGE OF CHARACHTER OR DIGIT. AT FIRST IT CREAT A MODEL BASE ON TRAINING DATASET
AND THEN EVALUATE IT WITH VALIDATION DATA SET AND AT THE FINAL STEP IN PREDICT THE CHARACTER OR DIGIT OF THE IMAGE.

PROJECT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE PYTHON VERSION 3.7
IT CAN BE EXECUTED IN COMMAND PROMPT BY FOLLOWING COMMAND:
[DIRECTORY OF PYTHON EXE].PYTHON.EXE [DIRECTORY OF PYTHON FILE]
EXAMPLE: C:\Users\rahel\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts>python.exe C:\Users\rahel\Desktop\miniproject1.py
NAME OF THE PROJECT FILE IS : FOR EXAMPLE : DecisionT-ds1.PY
RUNNING PROGRAM WILL CREATE THE MODEL AND OVERRIDE EXISTING ONE IF ANY.
ALGORITHM IS SET TO RUN WITH ITS MODIFIED HYPER-PARAMETERS AS PER OF THE REPORT
